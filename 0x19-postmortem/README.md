**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Implement automated load balancer checks to keep it in line.
  - Enhance monitoring systems to sniff out troublemakers early.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Install load balancer behavior watchdog by February 15th, 2024.
  2. Upgrade monitoring systems to include traffic behavior analysis by March 1st, 2024.
  3. Schedule regular load testing parties to ensure everyone's playing nice by April 1st, 2024.
  4. Draft a comprehensive incident response playbook with clear escalation paths by February 28th, 2024.

**Visual Aid:**

*Imagine a diagram depicting a load balancer with one side overloaded with traffic, while the other side sits idle, sipping on a virtual cocktail. The load balancer is adorned with a mischievous grin, complete with a twinkle in its eye.*
